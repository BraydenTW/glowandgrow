# TheStarWithin

VividHacks '21.

## Inspiration

For most, starting a journal and reflecting on your daily go-abouts can be quite the haul. It's a tough habit to start and maintain and most of the time you won't know how to start.

## What it does

This is why we made [**TheStarWithin**](https://thestarwithin.vercel.app/). It is an app where you simply record one way you "glowed" and one way you can "grow" based off your day. Overtime, you can check your past daily logs, build up your daily streak to keep yourself on track, and learn more about how you can improve yourself each day.

Reflecting on your doesn't have to be complicated.

## How we built it

We built the app using React and NextJS on the frontend, TailwindCSS for styling, and Firebase for authentication and easy document storage for daily entries.

We used this tech stack because it is super quick to setup and, even better, is great for scalability.

## Challenges we ran into

I think the biggest challenge we ran into was communication. There was a lot of cramming together stuff towards the end of the competition and we wanted to make sure we had the full app completed on submission.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Some things we are proud of include being able to finish on time (haha), creating a great UI design and style, and building an app that many out there could truly gain from!

## What we learned

Definitely communication and building under a small window of time. We were able to build

## What's next for TheStarWithin

Over the next few weeks we will be adding features such as:

- Sharing your responses/daily streak count on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, etc. (this will attract more eyes to this awesome app)
- Adding more ways to visualize your daily logs
- Custom daily prompts?

We hope you enjoy using **TheStarWithin**!
